# Road Freight Transport in Latvia: Analysis of Volume and Fuel Consumption (2014–2023)

## 📖 Introduction
Road freight is one of the major modes of transportation in Latvia, followed by railway.  
Due to the steady increase in transportation demand, fuel consumption has also risen significantly (Eng.LSM.lv, Latvian Public Broadcasting).  

This study provides an analysis of **road freight transport in Latvia**, focusing on freight volume and fuel consumption over a 10-year period (2014–2023).  
The research also considers the **theoretical aspects of freight transport**, including:
- Historical development of freight transportation  
- Advantages and disadvantages compared to other modes  
- EU legal regulations relevant to road freight
